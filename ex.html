                    conserve the unique biodiversity of the region, particularly the gharial, a critically endangered
                    crocodile species, as well as other wildlife like river dolphins, turtles, and various bird species.

                    The sanctuary is known for its rugged ravines and riverine ecosystem, making it a significant site
                    for both conservation and ecotourism. Visitors can enjoy boat rides along the Chambal River,
                    providing opportunities for wildlife sightings and photography. Conservation efforts in the

                        The sanctuary is home to several unique and endangered species, such as the Tibetan antelope
